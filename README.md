# Used-Car-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts the selling price of used cars based on various features such as the car model, manufacturing year, mileage, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and ownership history. The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed through different visualization techniques. Several regression models are implemented and evaluated to identify the best-performing model for predicting car prices.
